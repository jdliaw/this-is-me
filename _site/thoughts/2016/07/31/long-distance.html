High school relationships become long-distance relationships when your paths diverge for your college education. Or you meet someone really special over the summer and you try to make it work when you both return to school in the fall.</p> <div class="divider"></div> <h3 id="i-was-in-a-long-distance-relationship-for-almost-a-year-in-my-first-years-of-college">I was in a long distance relationship for almost a year, in my first years of college.</h3> <p>The crazy thing was that we <strong>started</strong> our relationship as long distance. We knew each other from years before, but not very well at all. It was just by the fact that we attended the same schools. But our friendship began the summer after graduation, and it slowly grew into a relationship that started at the end of winter break.</p> <p>But seriously, who would willing <strong><em>do</em></strong> that to themselves… put themselves through the hardships that come with an LDR by <strong><em>starting</em></strong> their relationship off that way (which, by the way, only makes the situation even harder, since you don’t even know what it’s like to be together).</p> <p>That’s besides the point, though.</p> <p>Because I was in a long distance relationship, people would ask me for advice now and then. These were people who were in relationships that were about to become long distance relationships and had heard of how hard it was and wanted some insight from someone who was going through it.</p> <p>I’d ask, “Well what do you want to know?” and they’d usually say, “Anything.”</p> <p>That’s real helpful.</p> <div class="divider"></div> <h3 id="honestly-in-my-opinion-theres-no-secret-to-long-distance">Honestly in my opinion, there’s no secret to long distance.</h3> <p>There isn’t any know-how or trick to it. The secret to “making long distance work” lies inherently in the bond and connection between the two people and <strong><em>how willing each side is to make it work</em></strong>. If that will is there, even if you might not know <em>how</em> to make it work, you will try your best to find out and figure out how, and it usually will work.</p> <p>When it comes to relationships, specifically in starting any, I always ask the question, <strong>Why?</strong></p> <p><strong>Why</strong> should I enter this relationship? <strong>What</strong> would be different from how we are now, as close friends who hang out together a lot, and maybe cuddle from time to time or whatever?</p> <p>And I ask these questions because there does need to be something that is different from just doing that. You can have flings or “things” where you have all of that above, but taking that extra step to commit to a relationship is asking certain things of me and I have to be sure that the other party sees it as that way too. Values the time and investment I will inevitably put into it because that’s how I take my relationships.</p> <p>It’s a step beyond close friendship, but it’s more than just seeing each other every day or something. There’s a deeper connection that needs to be developed and felt, and in distance, that connection is even more important thane ver.</p> <p>In this sense, <strong>distance is a test</strong> for all couples.</p> <p>It’s like how going through a really rough patch of your life tests your friendships, because the friends who are still there during the bad and not just the good are the ones who are your true friends.</p> <div class="divider"></div> <p>Distance isn’t just going to be a breeze right off the bat for any couple. That doesn’t mean it can’t be good though, there are just certain steps that need to be taken to make that change. And to know what steps to take is really to just know your partner well or get to know what they need or what you need. There’s no one answer that fits everyone.</p> <h3 id="that-doesnt-mean-that-i-dont-have-tips-still">That doesn’t mean that I don’t have tips still.</h3> <p>In my opinion and from my experience, you should:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Share.</strong> <br /> This is an important one. Share the big and the small, the happy and the sad, photos, videos, stories… and of course love. Should go without saying, right?</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Think of ways to surprise the other.</strong> <br /> Things like packages, letters, or videos… just to remind them of how much you care for them, and that they deserve to be treated special and feel special.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Talk often.</strong> <br /> Over the phone or over videochat. Stay connected. That verbal conversation really adds way more and is leagues beyond just texting or messaging all day. I think it’s incredibly important. So much more is communicated through tonal enunciation or facial expressions.</p> </li> </ol> <p>If you’re doing long distance for a really extended amount of time, like possibly indefinitely, one important thing is that <strong>you have to know when you’re going to be able to see each other next</strong>. Just knowing that at some point in time in the future you will be able to be together versus not knowing that, is such a huge difference. Without it, things get incredibly hard. On the hard days, thoughts like “why am I even doing this” (whole relationship when I don’t even know when I’m going to see them again) start crossing your mind and that’s when it’s bad.</p> <div class="divider"></div> <p>So I did long distance for about a year, and that relationship didn’t work out in the end because of reasons besides the distance, honestly. And then I got into another relationship, not long distance, and about 6 months into it I was doing long distance again, for the summer. And I currently still am in that summer.</p> <h3 id="so-this-summer-is-way-different-from-that-year-i-spent-doing-long-distance">So this summer is way different from that year I spent doing long distance.</h3> <p>During that previous relationships, there was a time when we would go for 5 months without seeing each other. That’s a really long time.</p> <p>The times that we did see each other were like 4 day Thanksgiving break, or 2 week winter holidays turned into 1 week because of family trips, or 5 day visits during my second round of midterms because he was semester and I was quarter system, and then weekends during the summer because I was still in LA for research.</p> <p>Fast-forward to the present, and my new relationship.</p> <p>We spend literally every day at school together just because we can and it’s so easy to, and we have the same schedules and enjoy doing the same things. And now for the summer, we both have internships but on opposite coasts. So we have to do long distance for about 11 weeks.</p> <p>Compared to like 5 months, that should be a piece of cake, right? <strong>Apparently not</strong>.</p> <p>It surprised me too. <br />I just found myself missing and yearning for him a lot more, and there were some really emotional days for both of us where it kind of just felt like it was taking a toll on us.</p> <p>What could it be? Here are my speculations…</p> <ol> <li> <p>Having the luxury of seeing each other every day, whenever we want, has spoiled us in a sense and made not having that privilege much harder.</p> </li> <li> <p>Following that same thought, spending so much of my daily time with him because we could has made me more dependent on him, so his absence is much more notable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Or maybe we actually just care about each other more and have much stronger feelings.</p> </li> </ol> <p>At the same time, this summer is an interesting case. Both of us are working, him in a totally new city, and me in a familiar city, but without many people around. And work itself is a new environment, which we both don’t know what to expect from and whose reality may come out to be different from what we had hoped for or imagined.</p> <p>So it could be loneliness, frustration, or unhappiness from other factors of just our general situation that has made it this way. It’s like those things <strong>with the addition of the fact that we can’t be together</strong> or one of us can’t alleviate the pains that the other is going through because all we can do is say that we believe in them and love them and sometimes that is enough, but a lot of times it isn’t. And that’s hard.</p> <div class="divider"></div> <p>One thing for sure though, I think this time around, <strong>distance has really strengthened our relationship</strong>.</p> <p>Like that saying, being apart makes you cherish the things you have more (…. or something like that), even Brandon himself has told me that this time apart has made him even more grateful and appreciative…</p> <p>It’s the fact that you can be xxxx miles apart and still be the first one that they turn to, for the big and the small, the bad and the good. And when you’re in a totally new environment in his case, where the experiences and people met haven’t always been the most positive, or in my case where there is a new environment but also a familiar environment that’s changed negatively… despite all that, there’s that one thing that’s still constant. <strong><em>Us.</em></strong></p> <p>You know, that I’ll always be there at the end of the day for a Facetime sesh, and we can always laugh about dumb things and talk in ridiculous voices to each other, and we can share our love for Food and Jet Tila and appreciation for good boba, and that we can always be vulnerable in front of each other and know that despite everything else, no matter what, in the end we can still come back to, fall back to, <strong>us</strong>.</p> <p>And it’s a beautiful thing.</p> <p>So <strong>thank you</strong>.</p> </article> <div class="back"> <a href="/">Back</a> </div> </main> </body> </html>
