As a UCLA resident, I often frequent areas such as Sawtelle, Santa Monica, or Koreatown for food.

In the few instances I've found myself in the grimy boardwalk of Venice (which has really been... like 3 out of 3 after biking on a tandem from Santa Monica (#justcouplethings)), or admist the hip shops & boutiques of Abbot Kinney, I'm always at a loss for what to eat.

Now that I spend 40 hours a week right in the middle of Venice beach and all its tourists, tourist scammers, and homeless population, I've discovered that there's more to Venice than Poke Poké (though that place is still top of my list) and Intelligentsia.

Shoutout to some of my co-workers, because without them and this opportunity this summer, I probably would have never ended up learning about these places, no matter how often I ended up in Venice after a tandem bike ride.

So here it is, from me to you... **Where to eat in Venice.**<br >
(Loosely grouped by location for your convenience.)

<div class="divider"></div>

## Beachwalk

For those of you who haven't been to Venice Beach before, the beachwalk is lined with restaurants and vendors selling overpriced "Thing 1" "Thing 2" bro tanks on one side, and street performers / artists / homeless people on the other. And there's always the token "street performers" that are really tourist scammers that round up a huge crowd to do like one jump and make a huge commotion in blocking the streets. But people ***always*** fall for them. Like you never see them without a huge crowd. It's incredible. But I'm getting off track.

With such a dense population of stores along this walkway, it's hard to know where to go and which places are good. That's where I come in. Everything I list has been tried personally.

### Poke Poké <span class="rating">✮ ✮ ✮ ✮ ☆</span>
*Poké, Acaí bowls* <span class="dollar-signs">**$**</span>

![PokeLocation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/pokepoke-map.png)

This place is pretty famous & touristy, but it's still the best poké place I've been to. Its strenghts lie in the quality of the fish, the size of the fish chunks, and the overall seasoning & flavor.

Many other poké places I've tried have unfortunately just tasted like raw fish mixed with rice and maybe seaweed or something. Their fish is seasoned super well with shoyu sauce and whatnot, that makes it actually taste like something.

![Poke]({{site.baseulr}}/assets/images/venice-eats/pokepoke.jpeg)

*Pictured: Big bowls of the Original flavor without rice, no toppings.*

The Li'l bowl looks really small but actually holds a lot and could easily satisfy anyone as a light meal. Extra bonus: they serve acaí bowls which aren't necessarily extraordinary, but still solid.

**My go-to:** The **Original** flavor with seaweed salad & masago (fish roe). The seaweed salad is *dank* and goes so well with the fish, imo.

Personally, the **Aloha** flavor is a bit spicy for me. They put a *lot* of red pepper flakes. And I don't fuck with sashimi covered in spicy mayo sauce (the **Spicy Tuna** flavor). Their last flavor is **Wasabi**, so if you really love wasabi.. go for it.

### El Huaríque <span class="rating">✮ ✮ ✮ ✮ ☆</span>
*Peruvian* <span class="dollar-signs">**$**</span>

![PeruvianLocation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/peruvian-map.png)

This place is a self-proclaimed, but also literally, hole-in-the-wall Peruvian joint that serves large portions of flavorful dishes. Its hidden location makes it difficult for the average tourist on Ocean Front Walk to spot it, but those who know about this spot know Venice.

Their two main specialties are the ***saltados*** and ***chaufas***. The *saltado* is a plate dish that is basically your choice of protein cooked with Peruvian spices and some Asian influence, served with vegetables, garlic white rice, and french fries. A very filling and satisfying dish.

![PeruvianEntrance]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/peruvian-entrance.jpg)

Equally filling and delicious is the *chaufa*, which is basically Peruvian fried rice with your choice of protein. Rice is stir fried with eggs, green onion, red bell pepper, and liberal amounts of oyster sauce & soy sauce before the protein is added in. This also comes with a green sauce (similar to the one that comes with the adobada at Tacos El Gordo, for those of you familiar) that you mix in with your fried rice to get a creamy texture and just elevates this dish to next levels of tasty. Huge portions, again, that could easily be made into two meals if you're an average to small eater like me.

![GreenSauce]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/peruvian-greensauce.jpg)
*That one time they gave us all the green sauce*

An extra bonus is that you can [order online](http://www.elhuariquevenice.com/chownow/index.html) ahead of time! Place your order and they'll send you an email with the approximate time that it'll be ready, and you can pick up and eat without having to stand and wait.

**My go-to:** the Chaufa de Pollo, with extra green sauce.

### Tocaya Organica <span class="rating">✮ ✮ ✮ ✮ ☆</span>

*Mexican, Vegan, Juice* <span class="dollar-signs">**$$**</span>

![TocayaLocation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/tocaya-map.png)

Mexican & Vegan. A quintessentially SoCal combo. I was treated out to this place for lunch on my first day, and rightly so, because it's a place that makes for a great first impression.

The place opened relatively recenty in Venice, and boasts organic cali-mex cuisine where vegan is the default. Meat & cheese options exist, but must be specified separately when you order. The menu ranges from tacos to breakfast burritos to fajita bowls (which are very popular on Yelp) to salads and more. Lots of choices, but you can't realy go wrong with whatever you end up ordering. They also have a taco combo where you can get two tacos + two sides for $10.50.

I'm personally not vegan, but for those who are, this is a great place because everything on the menu is vegan-friendly. Even the protein add-ons have vegan options, such as **"vegan soyrizo"**, aka chorizo for vegans made out of soy. No idea how it tastes, but it sounds promising. Another option is **"chipotle-dusted tofu"**. Every vegan Mexican-food lover's dream, I'm sure. They also have vegan options for cheese, like vegan pepperjack and vegan mozzarella, all of whose base ingredients seem to be tapioca & arrowroot. Pretty cool.

</div>
*Left to right: California Green taco w/ chicken, Barrio-style taco w/ asada, street corn side, and salsa flight side with chips.*

They also offer a lot of delicious-sounding, tropical & fresh drinks reminiscent of summer and vacation. A lot of coconut water, limeades, aloe, and even **Horchata**! They also have their share of juices, another trend that I find quintessentially LA. From classics like **Pipe Cleaner** and **Charcoal Lemonade** to their own takes such as **Tropic Thunder** and **Block Rockin Beets**, they've got the juice fans covered too. Honestly, this place just makes me feel like I'm on a coastal vacation.

The space itself is really nice; clean and relaxing. Everything is covered is a light-colored wood tone with plenty of light shining in, and there's a nicely decorated (aka string lights!!) patio area for extra seating: the place is actually pretty big. Overall, a hip & pleasant place for lunch that offers some fresh, organic, and tasty cali-mex food.

![TocayaInner](https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XXXQyMPEAxMQfj17kkj7cQ/o.jpg)

I really haven't been enough to have a "go-to" yet, so instead I'll give some **recommendations**: the Barrio-style taco, street corn side (this one is soo good and flavorful, and I happen to love elotés), and the guacamole side (comes with plantain chips and is plated really nicely). I'll definitely be back to try their breakfast burrito and the fajita bowl though!

### Zelda's <span class="rating">✮ ✮ ✮ ☆ ☆</span>

*Sandwiches, mini Doughnuts* <span class="dollar-signs">$</span>

![ZeldasLocation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/zeldas-map.png)

Zelda's is a great little sandwich spot in the same alley as El Huaríque and Groundworks coffee. Only three stars from me because the sandwiches aren't amazing, but are solid, and I like the skinny baguettes they use as their bread.

I ordered the **Prosciutto Mozzarella**, which is prosciutto with mozzarella, spinach, and tomatoes on a nice baguette roll, toasted. Pretty yummy and satisfying, especially considering how hungry I was... the place was pretty busy so we had a bit of a wait. I have yet to go back and try more sandwiches though, so again I can't list a go-to, though I would definitely order that sandwich again.

They also have a little doughnut assembly line machine that spouts out **mini doughnuts**. It smells really good, but looks really average honestly. I've seen these machines at other doughnut places (Doughnuttery in New York, Chelsea Market) trying to pose as something more, but you can't really embellish what it is. They're cute and seem to be really popular, but I don't know if I would ever buy some myself.

The wait can get long during peak lunch hours (especially if you run into Snapchatters getting lunch because they *always* lunch in huge groups), so place your order online beforehand!

## Abbot Kinney

Abbot Kinney is a hip little street filled with boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants, and more. There's a Warby Parker, a Rag & Bone, and the occassional "Build-Your-Own Bra" event. On the first friday of every month, the streets are lined with food trucks, including *Kogi* by LA Son Roy Choi. Despite how much of a hotspot it is, I've always had trouble finding really good food there. I've explored a bit more and come up with these three winners, but hope to try even more.

<div class="divider"></div>

### Tlapazola Grill <span class="rating">✮ ✮ ✮ ✮ ☆</span>

*Mexican* <span class="dollar-signs">$$</span>

![TlapazolaLocation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/tlapazola-map.png)

Our VP of Engineering claimed that this place was most likely just a front for money-laundering, so six of us led by Cory went out to prove him wrong. Actually, it was more like "Well now we *have* to go see it!"

But our VP was wrong. Tlapazola is a really nice family-style Mexican restaurant named after a city in Mexico, with nice outdoor patio seating and a good amount of customers. Their menu consists of lots of big portioned Mexican plates and burritos. The **burritos** come with guacamole, and the quesadillas are stuffed, not like those flat ones you usually get. They're fat and have dimension to them. I got a **fajita** plate because that's what I was feeling, and it was super satisfying.

One of their most popular dishes are the **enchiladas**. You get two, and they're each doused generously in sauce, one orange sauce and one house molé sauce. I'd definitely try that next time I go. They also have a drink menu with **margaritas** as big as my face and **Mezcal**, if you're having a boozy lunch. Overall, a great find.

**Recommendations**: Enchiladas with molé, but honestly the quesadillas or fajitas are solid choices too.

### GTA (Gjelina Take Away) <span class="rating">✮ ✮ ✮ ☆ ☆</span>

*American* <span class="dollar-signs">$$</span>

![GTALocation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/gta-map.png)

One of the three "child establishments" of the Gjelina trifecta in Venice (I made all those terms up myself), it's basically Gjelina's neighboring and cheaper sister. Both places don't have a sign (#nodifica), so you just kind of have to know about it or find it on Google maps. The menus are totally different though.

The space basically consists of a counter where you can ogle their displays of pastries, salads, and pizzas, and also place your order. Then behind the counter is their open kitchen, which is beautifully constructed with marble and wood, and looks so unbelievably clean and organized. Like a commercial kitchen, almost. I had a great time just ogling their marble pizza oven and fresh breads & ingredients lined up in the back.

![GTACounter]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/gta-2.jpg)

  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/gta-1.jpg">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/gta-3.jpg">
</div>

Since "take away" is in their name, you can either get your food as to-go or get it for here and eat in the little vine-encapsulated alley beside them, equipped with plenty of milk crates and tree stumps, and one small & low wooden table with a bench if you're lucky.

Albeit cheaper than their neighbor, the food is still pretty pricey. Breakfast toasts (avocado, salmon, egg) are , and their sandwiches are all $10 or more. Pizzas range from $14-$20. But the food all looks so beautiful and delectable, and the quality is quite apparent, I'm sure everything is made with the freshest ingredients.

</div>

On my visit Brandon & I ordered the **Chorizo pizza** and **Pork Belly Banh Mi**. The pizza was good (chorizo was nice and spicy, crust was soft & chewy but crunchy on the outside), and the pork belly was even better. Thick cuts of pork belly cooked perfectly and complemented well with pickled radish and a crispy baguette made for reactions that sounded like "Mmrrgghh!!", which is what pleasure sounds like when your mouth is full but your taste buds are happy.

I don't know how often I would come back because of the prices for the amount of food, and the food wasn't impressive enough for me to want to blow $15-$20 bucks on lunch. I would **recommend** the Pork Belly Banh Mi if you do go though!

### Salt & Straw <span class="rating">✮ ✮ ✮ ✮ ☆</span>

*Ice cream* <span class="dollar-signs">$</span>

![SaltLocation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/salt-map.png)

Originally from Portland, this hand-made ice cream establishment has graced LA with a second location in Abbot Kinney. They specialize in organic house-made ice cream & waffle cones, with unique but well-paired flavors, and have made quite a name for themselves.

They have a large selections of flavors, most of which you probably couldn't imagine how it would taste, but no worries because they let you sample as many flavors as you want, and their sampling spoons are the real metal spoons. That's how you know they're an *artisan* creamery.

![SaltnStraw](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SnqUagYz42ErG4FBfYm_Og/o.jpg)

The flavors are split into two sections: their signature flavors, available year-round, and their seasonal flavors, which change monthly and are always themed. July's theme this year is berries. When I visited the Larchmont location in March, the theme was basically anything green or St. Patrick's day related. This means that their flavors are always changing, which gives me a great excuse to go back every month heh. Of their classic flavors, some crowd favorites are the **Honey Lavendar**, **Almond Brittle**, and **Fig & Olive Goat Cheese**.

![HoneyLav](https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DKW59xS8CqTlJIx1h90IsA/o.jpg)

**My go-to**: Creamy, not too sweet, and flowery & fragrant, the **Honey Lavendar** on a waffle cone always hits the spot.

## Elsewhere in Venice

For other great spots I had to mention, but happen to be in more obscure locations.

<div class="divider"></div>

### Gjusta <span class="rating">✮ ✮ ✮ ✮ ✮</span>

*Deli, bakery, cafe* <span class="dollar-signs">$$</span>

![GjustaLocation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/gjusta-map.png)

Gjusta, the third establishment that completes the Gjelina trifecta, is a place that I really had never heard of and probably would not have discovered if it wasn't for experts at [Codifica](http://codificacoffee.com), and especially [dduan](https://twitter.com/dduan) who puts this place at the top of his list.

Following the trend of its sibling / parent establishments, this place doesn't have a sign and is honestly just a picket white building in a random location in Venice: between Main St. and Abbot Kinney, and right next to Google Venice. Easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. But now you guys are in the know.

<div class="two-img">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/gjusta-1.jpg">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/gjusta-2.jpg">
</div>

When you walk in it's basically a longggg counter starting with pastries and bread on the side closest to the street, and then going into fish, meats, pizzas, salads, and a coffee bar at the end. Apart from buying goods from their bakery and deli (which looked sooo good, in quality and in taste, and were just fun to ogle at), you can also order from their menu. For anything in the glass displays, you need to grab a number to get helped with for that. Ordering can be done at any point on the counter where there is someone who is free!

<div class="two-img">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/gjusta-3.jpg">

  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/gjusta-6.jpg">
</div>

Their menu consists of breakfast dishes, sandwiches, and some soups & salads. And of course they have a coffee selection. I opted for their **Lox Bagel**, or to be specific, their Classic Lox on a Sesame Bialy with Herbs & Sprouts, and Herb Cream Cheese. A bialy is basically a bagel, but cooked differently because it isn't boiled before it's baked. Wikipedia also says that they're supposed to have a *depression* filled with herbs / whatnot instead of a hole, but these ones definitely had a hole... The lox bagel was delicious though, and super satisfying and filling enough for lunch, and the herbs & sprouts went really well with it all.

</div>

I also ordered a cortado on the side. If you're eating there, you can simply find a spot at the bar or hang around there and they will come find you with your food (basically call out the name you give), and they also have nice patio seating out back. You can also [order online](https://ordering.chownow.com/order/4909/locations) ahead of time if you're in a time crunch. Overall, a really cool kind of hidden place with quality food and atmosphere.

### Bellissimo <span class="rating">✮ ✮ ✮ ✮ ☆</span>

*Sandwiches & more, Convenience store* <span class="dollar-signs">$</span>

![BellissimoLocation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/venice-eats/bellissimo-map.png)

So this place is actually a convenience store, but people walking by might not know that they also sell really great sandwiches too! The inside is literally just a small convenience store (but they sell some cool stuff like Torres truffle potato chips), but if you walk to the back there's another cash register where you can place an order for their sandwiches.

My favorite is actually their breakfast burrito, which is egg, avocado, salsa, cheese, and your choice of bacon, turkey sausage, or vegan sausage (personal preference of turkey sausage). It is soo ridiculously good and always hits the spot. They give you a small cup of Cholula on the side too which is perfect, and every bite is flavorful and juicy from the sausage. They also have a sandwich called The Hunter that my co-worker gets a lot that looks really good too.

It's a great hidden lunch spot for something quick but filling and tasty.

**My go-to:** Breakfast Burrito with turkey sausage.
